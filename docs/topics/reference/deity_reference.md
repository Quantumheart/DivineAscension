## Choosing a Deity

### Considerations

1. **Playstyle Preference**
   - **Aethra:** Support/healer, help teammates, defensive
   - **Gaia:** Tank, high survivability, frontline
   - **Morthen:** DPS, lifesteal, aggressive

2. **Alignment Philosophy**
   - **Good (Aethra):** Protect allies, fight evil, honorable
   - **Neutral (Gaia):** Balance, endurance, patience
   - **Evil (Morthen):** Power through death, embrace darkness

3. **PvP Strategy**
   - Want maximum favor? Choose Light or Shadow and fight the other
   - Want balanced matchups? Choose Nature for +100% vs everyone
   - Want to avoid same-faction PvP? Check server deity distribution

4. **Long-term Commitment**
   - Switching deities resets ALL progress
   - Choose a deity that matches your core playstyle
   - All 10 blessings take significant time to unlock

### Recommendations by Playstyle

- **New to PvP?** → **Gaia** (forgiving tank playstyle)
- **Like healing?** → **Aethra** (support and defense)
- **Aggressive DPS?** → **Morthen** (lifesteal sustain damage)
- **Want flexibility?** → **Gaia** (neutral with everyone)
- **Want rivalry?** → **Aethra or Morthen** (fight each other for max favor)

### Rock-Paper-Scissors Balance

The deities are designed as a balanced triangle:

```
        AETHRA (Light)
       /              \
  Heals/Shields    Holy Damage
     /                  \
GAIA (Nature)  ←→  MORTHEN (Shadow)
   Tank           Lifesteal DPS
```

**No hard counters** - all matchups are viable based on player skill and build choices.

## Lore: The Eternal Triangle

The Pantheon Wars represent an eternal struggle between three cosmic forces:

**Aethra's Light** seeks to banish darkness and protect the innocent. Her followers believe in the sanctity of life and the power of divine righteousness.

**Gaia's Nature** maintains balance between light and shadow. Her followers know that both are necessary parts of existence, and true strength comes from endurance.

**Morthen's Darkness** embraces death and shadow as ultimate power. His followers see mortality as weakness to be overcome through dark magic and soul harvesting.

The conflict is eternal - when Light grows too strong, Shadow rises to challenge it. When Darkness threatens to consume all, Light rallies to push it back. And through it all, Nature endures, weathering the storm.

**Your devotion shapes the balance.** Every kill, every blessing unlocked, every act of devotion strengthens your deity's influence in the world. Choose wisely, for the fate of the Pantheon rests in the hands of its champions.
