# Deity Reference Guide - Utility Focused

**Version:** 2.0.0 (Utility Redesign)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-24

Complete guide to deities in Pantheon Wars, redesigned with a focus on **survival utility** rather than combat. These deities reward practical skills - crafting, gathering, hunting, and building - that help players thrive in Vintage Story's harsh world.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Survival Over Combat**
- Deities provide bonuses to daily survival activities
- Combat is a means to earn favor, not the primary focus
- Blessings help you craft better, gather more, and survive longer
- Small percentages matter over hundreds of hours of gameplay

**PvP Integration**
- Earn favor primarily through PvP
- Earn favor slowly through utility activities (crafting, hunting, gathering)
- Better survival tools = better prepared for conflicts
- Asymmetric gameplay: crafters vs hunters vs builders

## Choosing a Deity

### Considerations

1. **Playstyle Preference**
   - Do you prefer crafting and building? → **Khoras**
   - Do you prefer exploring and gathering? → **Lysa**

2. **Base vs Nomadic**
   - Stationary base builder? → **Khoras**
   - Nomadic explorer? → **Lysa**

3. **Resource Focus**
   - Need metals and ores? → **Khoras**
   - Need food and animal products? → **Lysa**

4. **Environmental Challenges**
   - Struggle with cold climates? → **Khoras** (15°C cold resistance)
   - Struggle with all climates? → **Lysa** (8°C hot AND cold resistance)

### Synergy

**Khoras + Lysa religions work perfectly together:**
- Khoras provides tools and equipment
- Lysa provides food and mobility
- Combined: Self-sufficient community with all needs met
- Allied relationship gives favor bonuses

---

## Progression Tips

### Earning Favor

**Primary: PvP**
- Kill enemy players to earn favor
- Deity relationships affect multipliers (Allied: 0.5x, Neutral: 1.0x, Rival: 2.0x)

**Secondary: Utility Activities** *(Slower but steady)*
- Khoras: Mining ore, smithing, repairing tools
- Lysa: Hunting animals, foraging plants, exploring

### Blessing Strategy

**Early Game (Initiate → Disciple)**
1. Unlock Tier 1 blessing immediately
2. Choose your path based on playstyle
3. Focus on getting religion to Fledgling for group bonuses

**Mid Game (Disciple → Zealot)**
1. Specialize in your chosen path
2. Religion should reach Established
3. Combined bonuses become very noticeable

**Late Game (Zealot → Champion)**
1. Work on the other path to unlock capstone
2. Push religion to Renowned/Legendary
3. Maximum combined bonuses = dominant survival advantage

---

## Balance Notes

### Scaling Philosophy

**Conservative but Meaningful:**
- Low tier bonuses: 5-12% (noticeable in daily play)
- Mid tier bonuses: 15-25% (significant advantage)
- High tier bonuses: 30-45% (mastery level)
- Religion bonuses: Slightly lower than player (shared benefit)

**Why Small Numbers Matter:**
- 10% tool durability = 10% fewer repairs = significant material savings over time
- 25% ore yield = Finding 5 ore gives 6.25 ore worth of output
- 8% movement speed = Noticeable difference in exploration
- Small bonuses compound over hundreds of hours

**Stacking is Powerful:**
- Player + Religion bonuses stack additively
- Path choices create specialization
- Champion tier requires both paths (balanced power spike)
- Maximum combined bonuses: 60-80% in specializations

---

## Future Deities

The following deities are planned with similar utility-focused designs:

- **Agriculture/Farming deity** - Crop growth, animal husbandry
- **Building/Construction deity** - Structure building, material efficiency
- **Alchemy/Brewing deity** - Potion crafting, food preparation
- **Trade/Commerce deity** - Trading, economy, resource exchange

*Details subject to change based on community feedback and balance testing.*

## Lore Notes

The Pantheon Wars represent an ancient conflict between the deities for mortal devotion. However, these gods do not seek warriors - they seek **masters of their craft**.

Khoras teaches that civilization is built on the strength of quality tools and skilled hands. Lysa teaches that survival comes from understanding and working with nature, not against it.

Players are not merely followers - they are **practitioners** whose daily work and dedication directly strengthen their deity's influence. Every tool forged, every animal hunted, every resource gathered is an act of devotion.

The PvP conflict exists because resources are scarce and competition is inevitable. But the gods reward those who can both **survive** and **thrive** in this harsh world.

*More lore will be added as additional deities are developed.*
