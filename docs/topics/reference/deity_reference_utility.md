# Deity Reference Guide - Utility Focused

**Version:** 2.0.0 (Utility Redesign)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-24

Complete guide to deities in Pantheon Wars, redesigned with a focus on **survival utility** rather than combat. These deities reward practical skills - crafting, gathering, hunting, and building - that help players thrive in Vintage Story's harsh world.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Survival Over Combat**
- Deities provide bonuses to daily survival activities
- Combat is a means to earn favor, not the primary focus
- Blessings help you craft better, gather more, and survive longer
- Small percentages matter over hundreds of hours of gameplay

**PvP Integration**
- Earn favor primarily through PvP
- Earn favor slowly through utility activities (crafting, hunting, gathering)
- Better survival tools = better prepared for conflicts
- Asymmetric gameplay: crafters vs hunters vs builders

## Choosing a Deity

### Considerations

1. **Playstyle Preference**
   - Do you prefer smithing and tool-making? → **Khoras**
   - Do you prefer hunting and gathering? → **Lysa**
   - Do you prefer farming and cooking? → **Aethra**
   - Do you prefer mining and building? → **Gaia**

2. **Base vs Nomadic**
   - Stationary crafter? → **Khoras**
   - Nomadic explorer? → **Lysa**
   - Farmer/cook? → **Aethra**
   - Miner/builder? → **Gaia**

3. **Resource Focus**
   - Need metals and ores? → **Khoras**
   - Need food from hunting? → **Lysa**
   - Need crops and meals? → **Aethra**
   - Need stone and clay? → **Gaia**

4. **Environmental Challenges**
   - Struggle with cold climates? → **Khoras** (15°C cold) or **Gaia** (13°C cold)
   - Struggle with all climates? → **Lysa** (8°C hot/cold)
   - Struggle with heat? → **Aethra** (15°C heat)

5. **Survival Style**
   - Want durable tools? → **Khoras**
   - Want mobility and speed? → **Lysa**
   - Want endless food? → **Aethra**
   - Want high HP tank? → **Gaia**

### Synergy

**All four deities form a complete civilization:**
- **Khoras** provides tools and equipment
- **Lysa** provides hunting and wild food
- **Aethra** provides agriculture and cooked meals
- **Gaia** provides building materials and shelter

**Best Religion Combinations:**
- Khoras + Gaia = Industrial powerhouse (tools + materials)
- Lysa + Aethra = Food independence (hunting + farming)
- Khoras + Aethra = Self-sufficient settlement (tools + food)
- All four allied = Complete civilization with all needs met

---

## Progression Tips

### Earning Favor

**Primary: PvP**
- Kill enemy players to earn favor
- Deity relationships affect multipliers (Allied: 0.5x, Neutral: 1.0x, Rival: 2.0x)

**Secondary: Utility Activities** *(Slower but steady)*
- Khoras: Mining ore, smithing, repairing tools
- Lysa: Hunting animals, foraging plants, exploring
- Aethra: Harvesting crops, cooking meals, farming
- Gaia: Mining stone/clay, building structures

### Blessing Strategy

**Early Game (Initiate → Disciple)**
1. Unlock Tier 1 blessing immediately
2. Choose your path based on playstyle
3. Focus on getting religion to Fledgling for group bonuses

**Mid Game (Disciple → Zealot)**
1. Specialize in your chosen path
2. Religion should reach Established
3. Combined bonuses become very noticeable

**Late Game (Zealot → Champion)**
1. Work on the other path to unlock capstone
2. Push religion to Renowned/Legendary
3. Maximum combined bonuses = dominant survival advantage

---

## Balance Notes

### Scaling Philosophy

**Conservative but Meaningful:**
- Low tier bonuses: 5-12% (noticeable in daily play)
- Mid tier bonuses: 15-25% (significant advantage)
- High tier bonuses: 30-45% (mastery level)
- Religion bonuses: Slightly lower than player (shared benefit)

**Why Small Numbers Matter:**
- 10% tool durability = 10% fewer repairs = significant material savings over time
- 25% ore yield = Finding 5 ore gives 6.25 ore worth of output
- 8% movement speed = Noticeable difference in exploration
- Small bonuses compound over hundreds of hours

**Stacking is Powerful:**
- Player + Religion bonuses stack additively
- Path choices create specialization
- Champion tier requires both paths (balanced power spike)
- Maximum combined bonuses: 60-80% in specializations

---

## Future Deities

The following deities are planned with similar utility-focused designs:

- **Alchemy/Brewing deity** - Potion crafting, fermentation, transformation
- **Trade/Commerce deity** - Trading, economy, resource exchange
- **Animal Husbandry deity** - Livestock, breeding, animal products
- **Magic/Temporal deity** - Temporal stability, rift management
- **Exploration deity** - Navigation, mapping, discovery
- **Weather/Seasons deity** - Climate adaptation, seasonal bonuses

*Note: Aethra covers agriculture/farming, Gaia covers building/construction, Khoras covers smithing, and Lysa covers hunting/foraging.*

*Details subject to change based on community feedback and balance testing.*

## Lore Notes

The Pantheon Wars represent an ancient conflict between the deities for mortal devotion. However, these gods do not seek warriors - they seek **masters of their craft**.

**Khoras, God of the Forge**, teaches that civilization is built on the strength of quality tools and skilled hands. Without the smith, there are no plows, no picks, no means to shape the world.

**Lysa, Goddess of the Hunt**, teaches that survival comes from understanding and working with nature, not against it. The wild provides for those who know where to look and how to take only what is needed.

**Aethra, Goddess of Light**, teaches that abundance comes from cultivation. Light and warmth bring growth, and through patient tending of the land, civilization finds its sustenance.

**Gaia, Goddess of Earth**, teaches that endurance comes from connection to stone and soil. The earth is eternal, and those who draw strength from it become as immovable as mountains.

Together, these four deities represent the **foundations of civilization**: tools to work, food to eat, crops to cultivate, and stone to build shelter. Players are not merely followers - they are **practitioners** whose daily work and dedication directly strengthen their deity's influence.

Every tool forged, every animal hunted, every crop harvested, every stone quarried is an act of devotion. The PvP conflict exists because resources are scarce and competition is inevitable. But the gods reward those who can both **survive** and **thrive** in this harsh world.

*More lore will be added as additional deities are developed.*
