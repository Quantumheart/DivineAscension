# Deity Reference Guide - Utility Focused

**Version:** 2.0.0 (Utility Redesign)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-24

Complete guide to deities in Pantheon Wars, redesigned with a focus on **survival utility** rather than combat. These deities reward practical skills - crafting, gathering, hunting, and building - that help players thrive in Vintage Story's harsh world.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Survival Over Combat**
- Deities provide bonuses to daily survival activities
- Combat is a means to earn favor, not the primary focus
- Blessings help you craft better, gather more, and survive longer
- Small percentages matter over hundreds of hours of gameplay

**PvP Integration**
- Earn favor primarily through PvP
- Earn favor slowly through utility activities (crafting, hunting, gathering)
- Better survival tools = better prepared for conflicts
- Asymmetric gameplay: crafters vs hunters vs builders

---

## How Bonuses Work

### Bonus Stacking Rules
- **Player + Religion bonuses:** Stack additively (10% + 15% = 25% total)
- **Path A + Path B bonuses:** Stack additively when both paths are unlocked
- **Different bonus types:** Apply independently (ore yield × mining speed are separate)
- **Total percentages:** All "total: X%" values shown are cumulative across all unlocked tiers

### Dual Path Progression
To unlock Champion tier, players must:
1. Progress through Tiers 1-3 in their initial chosen path
2. Then progress through Tiers 2-3 in the alternate path
3. Champion tier unlocks when both Tier 3 blessings are obtained
4. Total favor needed: 5000+ (to reach Champion threshold with both paths)
5. Both path bonuses remain active and stack together

### Earning Favor
Favor represents your personal devotion to a deity through practice of their domain.

**Primary Method: PvP**
- Kill enemy players to earn favor
- All PvP kills grant the same amount of favor regardless of opponent's deity

**Secondary Method: Utility Activities** *(Slower but steady)*

| Deity | Activity | Favor Gain | Example                        |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **Khoras** | Mining ore | 2 per ore | 10 copper ore = 20 favor       |
| | Smithing items | 5-15 per craft | Iron pickaxe = 10 favor        |
| | Repairing tools | 1-5 per repair | Tool repair = 3 favor          |
| **Lysa** | Hunting animals | 3-20 per kill | Wolf = 12 favor, Deer = 8 favor |
| | Foraging plants | 0.5 per harvest | 20 berry bushes = 10 favor     |
| **Aethra** | Harvesting crops | 1 per harvest | 10 flax = 10 favor             |
| | Cooking meals | 3-8 per meal | Bread = 5 favor                |
| | Planting crops | 0.5 per plant | 20 seeds = 10 favor            |
| **Gaia** | Crafting pottery | 2-5 per craft | Storage vessel = 5 favor       |
| | Firing pottery in kilns | 3-8 per firing | Batch firing = 5 favor         |

*Note: Favor rates are approximate and may be adjusted for balance.*

### Religion Prestige
Prestige measures a religion's collective power and influence.

**How Prestige Works:**
- Each religion has a shared prestige pool
- Prestige increases when members perform deity-aligned activities
- Formula: Member favor gains contribute to prestige at a reduced rate
- Prestige unlocks religion-wide blessings that benefit all members
- Religion leaders can see total prestige in the religion panel

**Prestige Gain Rates:**
- Members earn favor normally for personal blessings
- 10% of earned favor also contributes to religion prestige
- Example: Player gains 100 favor → Personal: +100, Religion prestige: +10
- All members contribute, making larger religions progress faster

## Progression Tips

### Blessing Strategy

**Early Game (Initiate → Disciple)**
1. Unlock Tier 1 blessing immediately
2. Choose your path based on playstyle
3. Focus on getting religion to Fledgling for group bonuses

**Mid Game (Disciple → Zealot)**
1. Specialize in your chosen path
2. Religion should reach Established
3. Combined bonuses become very noticeable

**Late Game (Zealot → Champion)**
1. Work on the other path to unlock capstone
2. Push religion to Renowned/Legendary
3. Maximum combined bonuses = dominant survival advantage

---

## Balance Notes

### Scaling Philosophy

**Conservative but Meaningful:**
- Low tier bonuses: 5-12% (noticeable in daily play)
- Mid tier bonuses: 15-25% (significant advantage)
- High tier bonuses: 30-45% (mastery level)
- Religion bonuses: Slightly lower than player (shared benefit)

**Why Small Numbers Matter:**
- 10% tool durability = 10% fewer repairs = significant material savings over time
- 25% ore yield = Finding 5 ore gives 6.25 ore worth of output
- 8% movement speed = Noticeable difference in exploration
- Small bonuses compound over hundreds of hours

**Stacking is Powerful:**
- Player + Religion bonuses stack additively
- Path choices create specialization
- Champion tier requires both paths (balanced power spike)
- Maximum combined bonuses: 60-80% in specializations

**Temperature Resistance:**
- Most deities provide resistance to one temperature extreme
- Lysa uniquely provides resistance to both hot AND cold (separate values)
- Example: Lysa's 8°C resistance = 8°C hot + 8°C cold protection

## Lore Notes

The Pantheon Wars represent an ancient conflict between the deities for mortal devotion. However, these gods do not seek warriors - they seek **masters of their craft**.

**Khoras, God of the Forge**, teaches that civilization is built on the strength of quality tools and skilled hands. Without the smith, there are no plows, no picks, no means to shape the world.

**Lysa, Goddess of the Hunt**, teaches that survival comes from understanding and working with nature, not against it. The wild provides for those who know where to look and how to take only what is needed.

**Aethra, Goddess of Light**, teaches that abundance comes from cultivation. Light and warmth bring growth, and through patient tending of the land, civilization finds its sustenance.

**Gaia, Goddess of Pottery & Clay**, teaches that civilization is built from the earth itself. Clay shaped by skilled hands becomes the vessels that hold life - storage for grain, crucibles for metal, bricks for shelter. Through the potter's wheel and the kiln's fire, raw earth transforms into enduring utility.

Together, these four deities represent the **foundations of civilization**: tools to work, food to eat, crops to cultivate, and vessels to store it all. Players are not merely followers - they are **practitioners** whose daily work and dedication directly strengthen their deity's influence.

Every tool forged, every animal hunted, every crop harvested, every pot fired is an act of devotion. The PvP conflict exists because resources are scarce and competition is inevitable. But the gods reward those who can both **survive** and **thrive** in this harsh world.

*More lore will be added as additional deities are developed.*
